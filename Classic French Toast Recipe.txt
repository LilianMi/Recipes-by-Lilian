Classic French Toast Recipe (Serves 2â€“3)
Ingredients:

4â€“6 slices of bread (preferably slightly stale or thick-cut like brioche or challah)

2 large eggs

Â½ cup (120 ml) milk (or cream for a richer flavor)

1 tsp vanilla extract

Â½ tsp ground cinnamon (optional)

1 tbsp sugar (optional, for a sweeter version)

Pinch of salt

Butter or oil for frying

Toppings (optional but recommended):

Maple syrup

Powdered sugar

Fresh fruits (berries, banana slices)

Whipped cream

Nutella or peanut butter

ðŸ¥„ Instructions:
Make the custard
In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, vanilla, cinnamon, sugar, and salt until well combined.

Dip the bread
Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and add a bit of butter or oil. Dip each slice of bread into the egg mixture, letting it soak for a few seconds on each side (not too long or it will fall apart).
